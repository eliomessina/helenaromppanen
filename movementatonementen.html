        <h1>MOVEMENTATONEMENT</h1>
        <h2>dance-and-movement therapy</h2>

        <p>MOVEMENTATONEMENT

Movement is naturally inherent in us, in our breath, in the pulsations of our heart, in the fluid connectedness
of the tissues throughout all our body. Movement is that creative expression and force of life that enables
transformation. <br>Change, learning and transformation occur through adjustments to life and through the fundamental resonance
  of the whole organism in relation with its felt purpose and how it's linked to the environment.</p>

<p>That resonance reflects our underlying ability to atone and restore our natural state of being within those
  changes.</p>

<p>Stillness and silence create a transient space that lies underneath all that movement resonance:  in the space
  between each heartbeat, in the transition from exhalation into inhalation. Thus the essential meaning of atonement
  is at-one-ment, to be at one, in silence, to be at peace within ones authentic being.</p>

<p>Dance and movement that is practiced through somatic and framework, gives space for authentic self expression to
   emerge as an experience of holistic body-mind connectivity. This connectivity facilitates improved self image,
  creativity, confidence and ability to enjoy life which will tone the whole physical appearance as well.</p>

<p>Life is expressed as motion and change. As we approach our moving dancing body-minds, we aim to attune and
  give space to utter openness to life and it's manifestations.</p>



<p><em>MOVEMENTATONEMENT IS A MINDFULNES BASED CREATIVE DANCE AND MOVEMENT PRACTISE</em> that promotes well-being,
  vitality, change and awareness through mindful, psychosomatic body-mind connectivity.</p>

<p>The practices of movementatonement include movement and dance as well as physical exercises which encourage
  the development of strength, flexibility, breathing techniques, creativity, meditation and relaxation.</p>

<p>The domains of the therapeutic work span motoric, psychosocial and cognitive functions, including specific
  psychosocial issues related to attunement, attachment, authentic selfrelatedness and empathy.</p>

<p>The creative-therapeutic aspects of the work focus on and re-create sensitivity towards the movements of
  the body-mind entity, that spontaneously resonates with the deep neutral space of being within other people
  and within the living world of Nature around us.</p>

<p>During these sessions we aim to make an inquiry towards our own moving inner self space, witnessing with compassion
  our state of being and the emotions that arise from our individually experienced movement vocabulary and
  narratives. During the sessions we approach these narratives from various perspectives:
  Dance and movement improvised in moment, Relaxation, Mindful Awareness practices, Somatic practices and Movement
  Meditation practice.</p>

<p>Furthermore we explore a range of different practices including breath, posture, gesture, pedestrian and
  rhythmical movement and also more technical or style-specific form of dancing or other traditional movement
  meditation (MM) practices.</p>

<p>"With this openness and respect towards a variety of mental-physical disciplines and traditions cultivated
  both in modern western and ancient eastern culture, the purpose is to explore and integrate the relationships
  of the body, mind and surroundings and give space for a working atmosphere of unconditional self-acceptance that
  in itself carries the openness of peaceful and creative inner body-mind space. In this context, afforded by
  constant “emptying” and “filling” of the body-mind continuum with thoughts, feelings, sensations and movements
  lies a potentiality and freedom to atone, discover, unfold and change aspects of oneself, as a series of
  transformative energetic shifts will be naturally activated. The focus on unconditional self-acceptance
  during the practice will contribute to create an integration in the mind-body entity as a mutually influencing
  unit, enhance the sense of being present and the body-mind ability to relate itself to the physical world
  with more flexibility and ability to enjoy life and its manifestations”.
